# css-background-ping

This project shows how to create a background ping effect with CSS.

## Limitations

Full page ping fallback in IE 11 & Edge as they don't support clip-path.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
